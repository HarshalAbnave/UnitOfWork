The Unit of Work Pattern in C# is used to group one or more operations (usually database CRUD operations) into a single transaction and execute them by applying the principle of do everything or do nothing. That means if any of the operations in the transaction failed, then it will roll back the transaction. If all the operations are successful, then it will commit the transaction. So, it will execute all the database operations as one unit.
